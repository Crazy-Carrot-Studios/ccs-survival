## Description

**CCS Survival** is a production-oriented, module-driven survival framework. It ships playable bootstrap integration, validation tooling, persistence, and a manual playtest harness — without locking the codebase to a single commercial title.

Install via Unity Package Manager (**Add package from git URL**):

## Current Version

**1.8.1** — Settlement Services Polish + Blacksmith Routing

Settlement service routing cleanup with structured activation results (vendor, industry, placeholder, disabled, unavailable). **Blacksmith** at `CCS_TestTradingPost` routes to industry service summary — forge processes, recipes, and Primitive Forge requirement — without auto-craft or duplicate vendor logic. Availability flags on service points; playtest steps for blacksmith routing verification.

**1.8.0** — Frontier Settlement Expansion

Generic **Settlements** module with discovery tracking, service point interaction, and vendor routing through existing economy vendors. Bootstrap **CCS_TestTradingPost** includes General Store, Stable, Gunsmith, and Blacksmith placeholder. Settlement discovery persists in unified save.

**1.7.2** — Playtest Harness Cleanup + Input Action Consolidation

Dev hotkeys consolidated through `CCS_DevHotkeyUtility` / `CCS_KeyboardInputUtility` (New Input System only). Playtest HUD checklist grouped by survival domain. Validation scans ban legacy `UnityEngine.Input` and obsolete API usage.

**1.7.1** — Bootstrap Version Safety Cleanup

All legacy milestone bootstrap scripts now call `CCS_SurvivalBootstrapVersionUtility.EnsureBundleVersionAtLeast(...)` so re-running older bootstraps cannot downgrade `ProjectSettings.bundleVersion`. Validators use minimum-version checks instead of brittle exact pins. See **Bootstrap version policy** under Development Notes.

**1.7.0** — Prospecting and Mining Expansion

**Prospecting** frontier loop: iron/coal veins, stone outcrops, clay deposits, salvage mine debris, prospecting spot and abandoned mine placeholders, pick tier rules (primitive vs iron), industry iron refining, wagon bulk-haul weight hints, vendor buy paths for mining goods, gathering node save persistence, and playtest mining loop (Ctrl+Shift+M shortcut).

**Prospecting loop:** Find deposit → mine ore/coal → haul with wagon → refine at homestead → sell or craft better gear.

**1.6.0** — Firearm Foundation

Generic **Firearms** module with **Frontier Revolver, Rifle, and Shotgun**, ammunition crafting at the primitive forge, gunsmith economy, reload/fire active-item flow, wildlife hunting via existing combat raycast, firearm save/load, and playtest loop (Ctrl+Shift+G shortcut).

**1.5.2** — Wagon Foundation

Generic **Vehicles** module with **Frontier Wagon** ownership, summon/park, horse hitch follow, 24-slot wagon cargo, Frontier Stable wagon deed, vehicle save/load, and playtest wagon loop (Ctrl+Shift+W shortcut).

**1.5.1** — Horse Foundation

Generic **Mounts** module with **Frontier Horse** ownership, riding, saddlebag storage, Frontier Stable economy, camp horse presence, mount save/load, `Horse` camera placeholder, and playtest horse loop.

**1.5.0** — Frontier Industry Foundation

Generic **Industry** module for resource processing (wood → lumber, wood → charcoal, iron ore → refined iron) at Saw Table, Charcoal Kiln, and Primitive Forge workstations. Blacksmith forge recipes (tool heads, nails, horseshoe placeholder), iron tool upgrades, **IndustrialHomestead** camp tier, economy trade paths, industry save jobs, and playtest industry loop.

**1.4.1** — Frontier Homestead Foundation

Profile-driven camp tier ladder (TemporaryCamp → FrontierCamp → FrontierHomestead), placeable frontier storage (Supply Crate, Trapper Chest) and Frontier Workbench, camp ownership metadata on snapshots, General Store homestead kits, and playtest homestead progression with save/load tier restore.

**1.4.0** — Frontier Shelter Expansion

Frontier shelter kits (Lean-To, Tarp, Trapper), placeable shelter flow, camp tier tracking (shelter + campfire + bedroll → TemporaryCamp), camp/shelter save persistence, General Store cordage/canvas sales, and playtest frontier camp loop.

**1.3.4** — Cooking + Food Preservation Expansion

Campfire cook recipes for fish and all frontier meats, smoke-only jerky/dried fish preservation, consumable hunger tuning, General Store trail food trade, and playtest cooking loop (raw → cook → eat → preserve → sell).

**1.3.3** — Frontier Trapping Foundation

Placeable simple trap (preview + confirm), timer capture rolls for rabbit/turkey, knife harvest via wildlife harvest service, trap save/load persistence, and playtest trapping loop (craft → place → trigger → harvest → sell).

**1.3.2** — Frontier Hunting Foundation

Bow raycast hunting, knife wildlife harvest (skin/butcher drop tables), passive wildlife death/carcass state, General Store buys hunting trade goods (hide, meat, feather, fat, bone), and playtest hunting loop (bow → kill → harvest → sell).

**1.3.1** — Vendor Trading Polish + Tool Acquisition

Expanded General Store catalog, polished debug vendor HUD, safer buy/sell transactions, and hatchet trade progression (fish/salvage → dollars → hatchet → wood harvest). Knife-only starter unchanged.

**1.3.0** — Frontier Economy Foundation — currency/vendor framework, Trade Dollars, save-backed wallet, initial trade loop.

**1.2.6** — Frontier Starter Progression Rework — knife, camp, water, bow, fishing, traps, salvage, shelter, tools, and trade placeholders.

## Architecture

```text
Survival → Modules → Core
```

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Framework/Core** | Reusable CCS platform (runtime host, services, events) |
| **Modules** | Gameplay systems (`ccs.survival.*` module IDs) |
| **Survival** | Project composition — scenes, prefabs, profiles, validation |

**Rule:** Core must never reference survival or gameplay modules.

| Module validators | Per-module `Validate*` batch methods |
| Bootstrap scene | Scene bootstrap validation utility |
| Windows build | `CCS_SurvivalBuildVerificationBuildRunner.ExecuteBatch` |

## Development Notes

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Unity | Unity 6 |
| Camera | **Cinemachine 3.1** third-person follow (default) |
| Locomotion | `CharacterController` (animator root motion **OFF**) |
| Look | Reduced mouse sensitivity; safe pitch clamp |
| Architecture | Modular service-driven composition via bootstrap host |
| Bootstrap version policy | Milestone bootstraps must use `CCS_SurvivalBootstrapVersionUtility.EnsureBundleVersionAtLeast(CCS_SurvivalBootstrapVersionUtility.CurrentMilestoneVersion)` — never hard-code `Regex.Replace(..., "bundleVersion: X.Y.Z")`. Update `CurrentMilestoneVersion` when cutting a release. Foundation validation scans for stale hard-coded writes. |
| Input policy | Gameplay reads `Assets/CCS/Survival/Input/CCS_Survival_InputActions.inputactions` via `CCS_CharacterInputActionProvider`. Dev-only hotkeys use `CCS_DevHotkeyUtility` / `CCS_KeyboardInputUtility`. **Legacy `UnityEngine.Input` is banned.** |

### Bootstrap version policy

1. **Single source of truth:** `CCS_SurvivalBootstrapVersionUtility.CurrentMilestoneVersion` (currently **1.8.1**).
2. **Bootstrap writes:** Every `*BootstrapSetup.cs` that touches `ProjectSettings.bundleVersion` must call `EnsureBundleVersionAtLeast(...)` so older scripts only bump forward, never downgrade.
3. **Validators:** Check `bundleVersion >= CurrentMilestoneVersion` via `AddBundleVersionValidationIssue`. Do not pin exact milestone strings that break on the next release.
4. **Log strings:** Historical milestone labels in `Debug.Log` or playtest copy may stay unchanged (e.g. wagon bootstrap still logs `1.5.2`).
5. **New milestones:** Bump `CurrentMilestoneVersion`, build runner output folder, README, then run full validation and Windows build verification.

Utility: `Assets/CCS/Survival/Editor/Development/Bootstrap/CCS_SurvivalBootstrapVersionUtility.cs`

## Git Hygiene

Do not commit local Unity churn:

- `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`, `UserSettings/`
- `Builds/` (development build output)
- Incidental `ProjectSettings` edits unless intentional

See `.gitignore`.
